###H.W(Week-4-Game)

* Build a crystal guessing game
*Create 4 crystals
* Give the crystals a random value (1-12)
* Creat random numbers (19-120)

##Technologies Used

* html
* css ( finally)
* javascript
*jQuery


##Code Explanation

*From the random numbers created the computer generates one random number (from those random numbers, I called that number targetNumber)

*We have 4 values for the crystalscrystal values (it's in an array), and now the computer picks random numbers (from those 4 values I created earlier) and assigns each crystal a value.

*The user(player) is going to guess what the crystal values are and tries to match the number (targetNumber) given on the screen. If the player passes the target number then an alert pops up that says "you lose :("). if the players score and the targeted number are === another alert pops up that says "You WIN :)").
